# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the channel list interface to provide a hierarchical navigation experience with channel groups, individual channels, and EPG program listings. The new design will improve content discovery and navigation by organizing channels into logical groups and providing immediate access to EPG data for each channel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse channels by groups so that I can easily find channels of similar content types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the channel list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a first column containing all available channel groups
2. WHEN a user clicks on a channel group THEN the system SHALL display a second column showing all channels within that group
3. WHEN no group is selected THEN the second column SHALL be empty or show a placeholder message
4. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected group in the first column

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a specific channel from a group so that I can view its EPG programming schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a channel in the second column THEN the system SHALL display a third column showing the EPG program list for that channel
2. WHEN no channel is selected THEN the third column SHALL be empty or show a placeholder message
3. WHEN a channel is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected channel in the second column
4. WHEN switching between channels THEN the EPG list SHALL update to show programs for the newly selected channel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view EPG programs for a selected channel so that I can see what's currently playing and what's coming up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the EPG list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show programs with their title, time range, and current status (live/upcoming/ended)
2. WHEN displaying programs THEN the system SHALL indicate which program is currently live
3. WHEN displaying programs THEN the system SHALL show programs in chronological order
4. WHEN no EPG data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on an EPG program to watch it so that I can navigate directly to specific content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an EPG program THEN the system SHALL navigate to the player for that channel
2. WHEN navigating to a program THEN the system SHALL attempt to start playback at the program's start time if it's a catchup program
3. WHEN clicking on a live program THEN the system SHALL start live playback
4. WHEN clicking on a future program THEN the system SHALL start live playback for that channel

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and intuitive so that I can efficiently navigate through groups, channels, and programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display all three columns in a clean layout
2. WHEN columns have no content THEN the system SHALL show appropriate placeholder messages
3. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN the interface is resized THEN the columns SHALL adapt appropriately to the available space
