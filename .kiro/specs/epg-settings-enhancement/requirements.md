# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the EPG (Electronic Program Guide) settings interface to provide a more intuitive user experience. The current implementation lacks clear visual feedback and proper state management for EPG loading and management operations. This enhancement will add proper button states, loading indicators, conditional visibility, and a reset functionality to improve the overall user experience when managing EPG data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save EPG links with clear visual feedback, so that I know when my changes can be saved and when they have been applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the EPG input field is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Save EPG" button next to the input field
2. WHEN the EPG input is empty OR unchanged from the saved value THEN the system SHALL disable the "Save EPG" button
3. WHEN the EPG input contains a new/modified URL THEN the system SHALL enable the "Save EPG" button
4. WHEN the user clicks the enabled "Save EPG" button THEN the system SHALL save the EPG link and initiate EPG loading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want EPG management options to only appear when relevant, so that the interface is not cluttered with unusable features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no EPG link has been saved THEN the system SHALL hide all EPG management controls
2. WHEN an EPG link has been saved THEN the system SHALL show the EPG management section
3. WHEN the EPG management section is visible THEN the system SHALL display appropriate controls based on EPG loading state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during EPG loading and parsing, so that I understand the system is working and know when operations are complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving an EPG link for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with "Loading EPG" message
2. WHEN EPG data is being parsed THEN the system SHALL update the loading indicator to show "Parsing EPG" message
3. WHEN EPG loading/parsing is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the EPG input field and save button
4. WHEN EPG loading and parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the "Reload EPG" button
5. WHEN no EPG is loaded OR EPG loading is in progress THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Reload EPG" button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset all application data to start fresh, so that I can clear any problematic configurations or cached data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Reset Everything" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Reset Everything" THEN the system SHALL remove any loaded M3U file data
3. WHEN the user clicks "Reset Everything" THEN the system SHALL purge all parsed cache data
4. WHEN the user clicks "Reset Everything" THEN the system SHALL reset the EPG URL to empty string
5. WHEN the user clicks "Reset Everything" THEN the system SHALL return the interface to its default initial state
6. WHEN the reset operation is complete THEN the system SHALL hide EPG management controls until a new EPG is saved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent state management across EPG operations, so that the interface behaves predictably and prevents conflicting actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any EPG operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent simultaneous EPG operations
2. WHEN EPG loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
3. WHEN EPG data changes THEN the system SHALL update all dependent UI components accordingly
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the previous EPG state if available
